<h1>Minecraft survival tips</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Minecraft is a forever changing game, but one thing you should always keep the same is how you will survive your first night. People will say things like "do everything in creative and then change modes to survival, but I will show you best the best way to be a survivor in te best way possible</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1: The game</h2>
    <p>Minecraft is most commonly used as a challenging survivasl game where you fight deadly monsters and enemies, and must mine for and find materials to survive. This is a gamemode called survival. You can also play in a gamemode called creative where you have unlimited resources, and you can only die by falling into the void, which is pretty obiously, a void.</p>
    
    <p>The Minecraft universe is divided into three distinct dimensions. The dimension you start the game in, a world that looks much like our own with hills, grasslands, swamps, and other Earth-like geography, is known as The Overworld. Many people happily play Minecraft without ever attempting to leave The Overworld.

The second dimension is known as The Nether and is analogous (in appearance, at least) to a sort of Hell like place with lots of lava, stone, and creatures not found in The Overworld. If you are playing Minecraft in a linear get-to-the-end-of-the-game fashion, it’s necessary to work your way toward building a portal to The Nether in order to gather supplies.

The final dimension of Minecraft is known, appropriately enough, as The End. The End is sort of time-out-of-place purgatory where the player encounters the Minecraft equivalent of an End Boss, the Ender Dragon.</p>
    
<h2>Chapter 2:The Biomes</h2>
<p>There are 61 unique biomes, which can be divided into five basic categories where they are found. These include:
    <h3>Lush Biomes</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Plains biome</li>
  <li>Forest biome</li>
  <li>Swamp biome</li>
    <li>jungle biome</li>
<li>mushroom biome</li>
 
  

</ul> 
  <h3>Snowy biomes</h3>  
    <ul>
  <li>cold taiga</li>
  <li>snow plains</li>
  <li>snow mountains</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <h3>Cold biomes</h3>
  <li>extreme hills</li>
  <li>Taiga forests</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
    
  <ul>
      <h3>dry biomes</h3>
  <li>desert biome</li>
  <li>savannah biome</li>
  <li>mesa biome</li>
    <li>plateau biomes</li>
</ul>  
    
  <ul>
      <h3>ocean biomes</h3>
  <li>normal ocean</li>
  <li>deep ocean</li>
    
    </ul>  
    
    </p>
<p>If you want to know the name of the biome, simply press the f3 button, and that will bring up the debug screen, showing your coordinates and the biome you are in.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3:Minecraft structures.</h2>

<p>sometimes there is a chance of spawning near a structure loaded by the game. these structures are bulding that are automatically loaded into the world. These include:</p>

<p><h3>1.villages</h3>
The largest and most pronounced structures you’ll find on the surface of The Overworld are NPC (Non-Player Character) villages. Villages can be as small as 2-3 buildings, medium-sized with a dozen or more buildings, or sometimes (rarely) sprawling complexes in excess of a hundred buildings. Villages are populated by as you may have surmised, villagers.Villages can be generated in Plains, Savanna, or Desert biomes and each village type uses materials from its biome, e.g. desert villages will be composed primarily of sandstone whereas plains villages will be composed primarily of wood and cobblestone.</p>

<p>While simple homes are the primary structure found in villages, you may also find churches, farms, libraries, blacksmith, and butcher shops. Regardless of composition every village always has a well, and sometimes (rarely) you’ll find a village that is nothing but a well with no buildings.
Although you can raid villages for resources (the libraries have bookshelves you can steal, for example) many players leave them intact and even build additional buildings for the villagers.
Two resources you can tap into (without destroying any part of the village in the process) are the chest within the blacksmith shop and the farms.
Look for a flat-topped building with no door and a small pool of lava and you’ve found the blacksmith. Inside you’ll find a small chest that typically has food and tools in it. Go ahead and stock up if you find it. We’re sure the blacksmith won’t mind.
You can also harvest the crops from the farmland (look for raised beds with fertile dirt and a water trench in the center) and simply replant them. Crops almost always yield more on harvest than is required to regrow them so you can scoop up the crops and replant them to keep the village looking pristine, and producing food.</p>

<h3>2. desert temples</h3>
<p>Pyramid-like in shape with two towers at the front, desert temples are abandoned temples made of sand, sandstone, and wool blocks that feature a hidden chamber in the base rigged with explosive traps. The hidden chamber is always worth exploring as it has four chests full of various randomly-selected loot such as diamond horse armor, gold, and enchanted books.
Although things can go terribly wrong if you set off the explosive trap in the heart of the temple, the temples are usually completely unoccupied and with careful digging you can get a bunch of loot with very little effort. The amount of loot-to-risk ratio is stacked heavily in favor of the player and desert temples are, in light of this, the most valuable structures in the game.</p>

<p>In addition to the loot hidden in the chamber, the booby trap itself is a type of valuable loot. Early in the game the grid of TNT blocks under the floor of the hidden chamber can be easily harvested without the hassle of actually gathering materials and crafting TNT.

Although the simplest way to find a desert temple is to simply wander around a desert looking, you can also find them while mining. Desert temples have a column of supporting sandstone that runs dozens of blocks beneath the temple’s main chamber so if you encounter an unusual column of sandstone while mining, you’ll know you’re beneath a desert temple.

While it’s tempting to turn a temple into a base, we’d recommend against it unless you’re near another biome. Deserts are rather unforgiving biomes; there’s no natural source of food unless you want to invest the energy to set up a farm. The only creatures that spawn there want to kill you, and you’ll spend a lot of time hiking to other biomes for resources like wood.</p>

<h3>3. Jungle temples</h3>
<p>If desert temples have an Egyptian influence, jungle temples definitely have a Mesoamerican influence and look similar to Mayan/Aztec ruins. They are composed mostly of cobblestone and mossy cobblestone and appear only in the Jungle biome.

Like the desert temple, the jungle temple is rigged with traps and features hidden chests with loot. Also like the desert temple, the traps themselves are worth looting as they’re a good source of arrows that require no supplies or crafting.

In addition, the jungle temple is an introduction to redstone, the magical electrical-like substance that serves the purpose of creating circuits and other simple logical/electrical constructions in Minecraft. While the trap in the desert temple is technically redstone-driven, it isn’t a complex mechanism. The pressure plate is a simple switch that activates the TNT beneath when you step on it.</p>

<p>The puzzle traps found in jungle temples are actually complex redstone circuits that feature levers, wires, and mechanical devices like pistons. If you’re interested in studying the redstone circuits then we’d encourage you to carefully dig around all the levers you find in order to reveal the mechanisms behind the walls.

Once the traps are disarmed and the materials harvested, a jungle temple can make a nice little tropical home.

Recall also, jungle temples are the most abundant source of mossy cobblestone outside of the relatively recent addition of the large mossy boulders in the Mega Tiaga biome.</p>

<h3>4. Witch huts</h3>
<p>Witch Huts are one of the simplest building-structures in the game. Witch Huts generate primarily in swamp biomes, sometimes in plain biomes, only rarely in other biomes, but never in deserts or jungles (the same in-game flag used for the Desert Temple and Jungle Temple is used for the Huts so there is never an overlap between their respective biomes). Witches, which spawn inside Witch Huts, are an aggressive NPC (Non-Player Character).</p>

<p>There is never any loot inside Witch Huts, but there is almost always a crafting table. Although not as interesting as other building types, an empty Witch Hut can be used as small ready-built shelter with the addition of a door.

That said, low-level players should avoid Witch Huts as the Witches found inside can easily overwhelm the underequipped.</p>

<h3>5. Abandoned mineshafts</h3>
<p>Although the world of Minecraft is wide open and largely devoid of other people (save for those rare villages you run into), you’d be wrong in assuming you were the first person to swing a pickaxe and descend into the depths of the stone looking for loot. The world is littered with Abandoned Mineshafts.

Abandoned Mineshafts are a fantastic find as they spare you the hassle of digging elaborate tunnels yourself (and you can easily branch off of them in search of ore) and they’re full of materials you can harvest such as fence posts, wood blocks, and mine cart rails. Additionally, you’ll frequently find abandoned mine carts with chests full of food and loot; even the cobwebs can be harvested.

Although all it takes to be an Abandoned Mineshaft according to the game code is an entrance area (usually “caved in” and long since buried) along with some corridors and intersections, the game engine typically generates many Mineshafts together in elaborate underground structures. You can easily spend hours and hours exploring and looting a single one of these mega complexes and adjacent caverns and underground structures.</p>

<p>Mineshafts also intersect other things (caverns, ravines, Dungeons, Strongholds, etc.) with a high degree of frequency. Even if you’re not interested in looting the Mineshaft for supplies, it’s worth exploring because it allows you to rapidly move through the stone layers of the map without digging.

One thing you’ll notice while exploring Abandoned Mineshafts is that you’ll frequently find exposed ore veins. Depending on the depth you’ll find coal and iron, as well as even gold and diamond. We have a burning question about the Abandoned Mineshafts: what exactly were the miners digging for that was so valuable they were willing to keep on trucking right past piles of diamond and gold? Clearly, they were on a mission!</p>

<h3>6. Dungeons</h3>

<p>Although the term dungeon calls to mind sprawling video game lairs that require lots of time to explore, Minecraft dungeons are actually simple structures that are between 5×5 and 7×7 blocks wide. These simple underground structures house 0-2 chests as well as a monster spawner (a small cage-like block that generates monsters every few minutes).</p>

<p>Dungeons are notable in that they are the only place in the game you’ll find music discs in loot chests. In addition you’ll usually find gold, iron, food, and various seeds in the chests.

Although you might be tempted to destroy the monster spawner immediately, we’d actually encourage you to place torches around it and wall it up. Monster spawners can be invaluable sources of renewable loot and experience (we’ll discuss the idea of “farming” a spawner in a later lesson).

Dungeons are the third and final place, besides mossy boulders and Jungle Temples, where you’ll find mossy cobblestone.</p>

<h3>7. Strongholds</h3>

<p>Strongholds are underground fortresses and are the most castle-like structure found in Minecraft. They’re also incredibly rare; only three Strongholds spawn per map. They are extremely difficult to just stumble upon them and, unless intersected by a ravine, cavern, or Abandoned Mineshaft, the only way to find them is by using an Eye of Ender, a piece of end-game equipment.

Speaking of Abandoned Mineshafts, remember our puzzlement over why the miners would blow right past diamonds and keep on mining? One of our pet theories is that whoever these long gone miners that preceded us were, they weren’t mining to find the riches of gold and diamonds, they were mining to find the extremely rare strongholds.</p>

<p>The structures are worth seeking out for two reasons. They make very secure homes that are filled with a wide variety of loot like gold, enchanted books, swords, and diamonds. They also always have a “Portal Room” which features a portal the player can activate in order to pass into The End, the final dimension of the game where the Ender Dragon lives.

Although the structure of the Stronghold is randomly generated the Stronghold will always include, as previously mentioned, a Portal Room, and typically includes a large library, store rooms, fountains, hallways, small empty rooms, and prison cells. If you’re looking for a super-secret bunker that comes with everything short of a mini fridge, you can’t go wrong converting Stronghold into base.</p>


<h2>Chapter 4. Meet the mobs</h2>

Minecraft mobs afford you the ability to interact (such as with villagers and taming animals), to eat (such as with the passive food-proving mobs), and the ability to fight (you’ll find more than a few creatures big and small that are rather unfriendly).

In Minecraft lingo, these creatures belong to “mobs” and can be divided broadly into Passive, Neutral, Utility, and Aggressive mobs.

If in the course of play you get the distinct feeling that the balance of friendly-to-hostile creatures is tipped strongly in favor of the hostile creatures, you’re not imagining it. The rate of spawning for aggressive mobs is measured in fractions of a second whereas the spawn cycle for passive mobs (such as animals) is nearly half a minute long.

Every 1/20th of a second the game asks “Should I spawn an aggressive mob near the player?” whereas it only asks “Should I spawn a passive mob near the player?” only once every 20 seconds (and only during daylight on the surface). Those odds mean you’ll run into far more aggressive mobs than passive mobs.

<h3>Passive mobs</h3>

Passive mobs are composed of creatures that will never, under any circumstances, attack the player. Some passive mobs can be bred to create more of them, e.g. pigs can be bred to effectively farm them. Aside from the bats, passive mobs always spawn at the highest illuminated elevation available for the chunk they are spawning onto.

This means even a well illuminated cave under a plains biome will never have a cow randomly spawn into it as the cow would always spawn on the surface grassland above.

<h4>Pigs</h4>
Pigs are typically found roaming in small herds of 3-4 members and spawn in grassy/forested areas. When killed they yield 1-3 raw pork chops (but if killed by fire, they drop cooked pork chops). In addition to hunting them for food, players can also breed them (by feeding them carrots) to produce more pigs and can place a saddle on them in order to ride them like a small and slow horse. A small and slow horse you need to lead with a carrot and stick if you want to get anywhere, that is.

<h4>Sheep</h4>

Sheep spawn in groups of 2-8 animals in grassy/forested area and provide the player with wool (useful for crafting items like a bed). Killing a sheep will yield one block of wool, shearing the sheep will leave the sheep alive and yield 1-3 blocks of wool.

Although wool is handy, it can be frustrating if the biome you’re in is sheep heavy (as they produce nothing the player can eat).

Sheep can be bred by feeding them wheat. Roughly 80 percent of all naturally spawned sheep in the game are white, but sheep can spawn as black, brown, gray, light gray and, very rarely, pink.

In addition to the basic colors, you can dye sheep other colors like yellow, blue, and green, and the dyed sheep will remain that color (producing as much of the colored wool was you wish to shear from them).

<h4>Chickens</h4>

Chickens produce more than one kind of drop. When you kill a chicken it will drop 0-2 feathers and one serving of raw chicken (cooked chicken if killed with fire). Left alive, they will drop a chicken egg every 5-10 minutes. Eggs can be harvested and to spawn more chickens or used in recipes.

Spawning chickens is rather fun: you throw the collected eggs like baseballs and each broken egg has a chance to spawn a chick.

Chickens may be bred using seeds (such as wheat, melon, or pumpkin seeds). Chickens spawn in grassy/forested areas.

<h4>Cows</h4>

Like the other farm-type animals, cows spawn in grassy/forested areas in groups of 2-8. Like chickens, cows are a fairly versatile creature as they supply both food (1-3 raw beef when killed, steaks if killed by fire), as well as milk if milked using a bucket and 0-2 leather units upon death.

They can be bred using wheat and will happily follow you if you hold wheat in your hand. Walk slowly enough and you can easily get the entire herd to follow you.

<h4>Mooshrooms</h4>

Mooshrooms are like mutant cows, they use the same body model as the cow but only spawn in herds of 2-8 mooshrooms, in the rare Mushroom biome. Just like the cows, they produce leather and beef if killed (steak if killed with fire), and they can be milked with a bucket.

In addition to the standard cow-like item drops however, the mooshrooms can also be sheared (they’ll drop five red mushrooms) can they can be “milked” using a bowl and they’ll produce mushroom stew. Thanks to the wide variety of drops available from the mooshroom, it’s the most versatile creature in the game. Mooshrooms can be bred with wheat.

<h4>Horses</h4>

Horses (and less frequently donkeys), spawn in the plains/savannah biomes. If killed they drop 0-2 leather units and in rare cases, if they have any additional equipment, a saddle, horse armor, or chest. Given that the majority of horses only yield a small amount of leather, it’s more practical to tame and saddle them to use them as transportation.

To tame a wild horse, simply click on it to ride it. The horse will throw you off. Repeat the process until the horse remains calm. Alternatively, you can instantly tame a horse with a saddle. Regardless of how you tame the horse, a saddle is required to direct the horse’s movement once tamed.

Horses can be bred using golden apples or carrots; a horse bred with a donkey yields a mule which, like the donkey, can be outfitted with a chest to help transport materials. Given the relative expense of creating golden apples and carrots (they’re essentially the base fruit/vegetable coated in gold) you have to be really set on breeding horses to undertake it, but hey, nobody said running a horse ranch would be cheap.

<h4>Ocelots</h4>

Ocelots are wild cats found in the Jungle biome. When wild, all ocelots look the same—tan color with brown spots.

Players may tame wild ocelots however, using raw fish. After feeding the wild ocelot raw fish it will turn into a domestic cat and assume one of the three color patterns reserved for cats. Ocelots/cats are immune to fall damage and are excellent at warding away Creepers (an aggressive mob creature we’ll meet in a moment).

Unless commanded to sit (by right-clicking on them) cats will wander around and follow the player. Minecraft cats, much like real world cats, enjoy hopping up on beds, chests, and other elevated surfaces.

<h4>Bats</h4>

Bats spawn naturally in caves and other large enclosed dark spaces. Despite your first reaction to smack them away, unlike in most videos games the bats are completely harmless. Not only that but they’re relatively useless as they have no drops, cannot be tamed, and provide no experience when killed.

They are useful however, as they tend to be rather noisy and are a good indicator of a nearby cavern. When digging mineshafts it pays to listen for the squeak of bats as it typically indicates a nearby cave system. Bats are the only flying passive mob.

<h4>Squids</h4>

Squids are found in any biome that has water. Despite the name, the squid body model is actually closer in shape to that of an octopus.

Squids are completely passive and, when killed, will drop 1-3 ink sacs. These sacs may be collected to use as dyes and in the creation of more advanced craftable items like the book and quill.

<h4>Villagers</h4>

Villagers are the only human (or perhaps we should say human-like) characters in the game and spawn in villages. Each villager has a profession (indicated by their robe/apron color); brown-robed villagers are farmers, white-robed are librarians, purple-robed are priests, black-aproned villagers are blacksmiths, and white-robed are butchers.

You can right-click on villagers to trade with them; their profession has a strong influence on what they will trade with you. Villagers always trade items for emeralds or emeralds for items, e.g. they want twenty raw chickens for five emeralds.

Although oftentimes the trade strongly favors the villager, we’d still recommend checking trades when you’re near a village as it’s possible to collect higher level/hard-to-obtain items fairly easily using the trade system. We frequently run into farmers who will happily trade emeralds in exchange for stacks of wheat (we presume they’re independently wealthy and simply want more farmhands as we always trade them wheat right out of their own fields).

Although villagers reproduce if the population of the village drops (you’ll occasionally see little miniature child-size villagers running around) they have no gender-distinguishing features and, save for their clothing color, all look identical.

<h3>conclusion</h3>
Well, this is the end of part one and if you read the info, then you should have survived your first few days no problem. there will be a part 2 and we will get into the more advanced stuff in that part. See you later!
